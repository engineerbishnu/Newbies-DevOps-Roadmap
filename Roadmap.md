# DevOps Roadmap for Beginners

## Introduction to DevOps
DevOps integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. It's centered around automation, collaboration, and continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD).

## ðŸ“š Step-by-Step Roadmap:

### 1. Understand the Basics
- **What is DevOps?**
  - Practices combining Dev and Ops, emphasizing communication and integration.
  
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **CI (Continuous Integration):** Frequently merging code to detect bugs early.
  - **CD (Continuous Delivery):** Automating deployment to production.
  - **IaC (Infrastructure as Code):** Managing infrastructure through code.

### 2. Learn Foundation Skills
- **Basic Programming:** Python or JavaScript for automation and scripting.
- **Operating Systems:** Learn Linux basics (commands, networking).
- **Networking:** Understand IP addresses, DNS, firewalls, etc.

### 3. Dive into Version Control
- **Git:** Learn version control basics to manage code changes.
- **GitHub:** Collaborate and manage projects with Git.

### 4. Master CI/CD
- **Jenkins:** Automate software builds and deployments.
- **GitLab CI/CD:** Build pipelines for continuous integration/delivery.

### 5. Learn Configuration Management
- **Ansible:** Use YAML templates for configuration management.
- **Puppet:** Automate infrastructure provisioning.

### 6. Understand Containerization & Orchestration
- **Docker:** Run apps in isolated containers.
- **Kubernetes:** Orchestrate and manage containers in clusters.

### 7. Explore Cloud Platforms
- **AWS:** Learn basic services like EC2, S3, and RDS.
- **Azure:** Explore Microsoftâ€™s cloud offerings.
- **Google Cloud (GCP):** Learn Google's cloud solutions.

### 8. Learn Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Terraform:** Define infrastructure as code for easy provisioning.

### 9. Implement Monitoring & Logging
- **Prometheus:** Monitor your applications and servers.
- **ELK Stack:** Visualize and analyze log data.

### 10. Get Hands-On Experience
- Build and automate CI/CD pipelines.
- Use IaC to manage infrastructure.
- Deploy real-world applications using containers.

### 11. Continuous Learning
- Enroll in online courses, join DevOps communities, and stay updated on industry trends.
