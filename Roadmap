### **Introduction to DevOps**
DevOps combines software development and IT operations, shrinking the development life cycle while delivering high-quality software on a continuous basis. Focus areas are automation, collaboration, and building/delivery in CI/CD.

### ???? Roadmap:

1. **Understand the Basics**
   - **What is DevOps?**
     - It sets practices through which one can combine Dev with Ops-communicate and integrate.
- **Key Concepts:**
     - **CI:** Continuous Integration generally means early and frequent integration to find the bugs.
     - **CD:** Continuous Delivery would mean automation at the production level.
     - **IaC:** Infrastructure as Code is the concept for managing your infrastructure with code.

2. **Foundation Skills to Learn**
   - **Basic Programming:** Learn at least Python or JavaScript for automation and scripting.
- **Operating Systems:** Learn the basics of Linux, including commands and networking.
   - **Networking:** Understand IP addresses, DNS, firewalls, etc.
3. **Dive into Version Control**
   - **Git:** Learn version control basics in order to maintain changes to code.
   - **GitHub:** Learn version control in collaboration on managing projects.
4. **Master CI/CD**
   - **Jenkins:** Automate software builds and deployments.
   - **GitLab CI/CD:** Create pipelines for continuous integration/delivery.

5. **Learn Configuration Management**
	* **Ansible:** Manage configuration using YAML templates.
	* **Puppet:** Automate the provisioning of infrastructure.
 
6. **Understand Containerization & Orchestration**
	* **Docker:** Allow applications to run on your OS in isolation.
	* **Kubernetes:** All management and orchestration regarding containers are done in clusters.
 
7. **Familiarize Yourself with Cloud Platforms**
	* **AWS:** Know its basic services such as EC2, S3, RDS.
	* **Azure:** Learn about Microsoft's offering of cloud computing.
- **Google Cloud (GCP):** Understand the cloud solutions offered by Google.

8. **Learn Infrastructure as Code**
   - **Terraform:** Describe your infrastructure as code for easy provisioning.

9. **Monitoring & Logging Implementation**
   - **Prometheus:** Monitoring of applications and servers.
   - **ELK Stack:** Creating log visualizations and analysis.

10. **Hands-on Experience**
     - Build and automate CI/CD pipelines.
- Utilize Infrastructure as Code to manage the infrastructure.
    - Deploy actual applications on the containers.
 
11. **Continuous Learning**
    - Go through online courses, join the communities associated with DevOps, and keep yourself updated about the industry trends.
